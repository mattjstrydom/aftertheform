          <h2 id="clause-1" className={h2}>1. Who we are</h2>
          <C n="1.1">
            &quot;We&quot; and &quot;us&quot; means {site.legalEntity}, trading as {site.brand}. &quot;You&quot; means the business that buys from us. That can be an agency buying for one of its clients, or a company buying for itself.
          </C>
          <C n="1.2">These terms apply to the check and fix (including the agency pilot) and to the monthly plan. They also apply to any extra work we quote in writing.</C>

          <h2 id="clause-2" className={h2}>2. Prices and payment</h2>
          <C n="2.1">All prices are in US dollars and paid through Stripe.</C>
          <C n="2.2">
            <strong className="font-medium">Check and fix:</strong> $1,200. <strong className="font-medium">Agency pilot:</strong> $900 if you agree to a short case study and a 20-minute debrief, or $1,200 without.
          </C>
          <C n="2.3">You pay 50% at kickoff and 50% on delivery of the report. Both are by Stripe invoice, due on receipt.</C>
          <C n="2.4">
            <strong className="font-medium">Monthly plan:</strong> $1,500 a month for up to 3 client accounts, $2,500 a month for up to 5, and $400 a month for each extra account. It&apos;s billed monthly in advance by Stripe subscription.
          </C>
          <C n="2.5">
            <strong className="font-medium">Extra work:</strong> ops work outside the monthly plan (for example routing, clean-up, reporting or new builds) is sold in blocks at $150 an hour, with a 5-hour minimum. We agree it in writing before we start.
          </C>
          <C n="2.6">If you join the monthly plan within 14 days of the day 30 recheck, we credit the pilot fee against your first month.</C>

          <h2 id="clause-3" className={h2}>3. What the check and fix includes</h2>
          <C n="3.1">One HubSpot portal and one individual Google Ads account (not a manager account).</C>
          <C n="3.2">Seven checks, and fixes to the items we find in HubSpot, Google Ads and Tag Manager settings.</C>
          <C n="3.3">A report with a screenshot for every finding, a change log with steps to undo each change, a recorded walkthrough and a 30-minute handover call.</C>
          <C n="3.4">Delivery within 7 business days of receiving the access we need, not counting time spent waiting for your approval.</C>
          <C n="3.5">A free recheck at day 30.</C>
          <C n="3.6">We don&apos;t make any change without your approval.</C>
          <C n="3.7">
            <strong className="font-medium">Not included:</strong> website code outside Tag Manager, redesign of lifecycle stages or lead scoring, campaign management, Salesforce, and syncs run from a manager account.
          </C>

          <h2 id="clause-4" className={h2}>4. If we find nothing to change</h2>
          <p>If none of the seven checks finds anything that needs changing, the kickoff payment is the full fee. We never invoice the second half, and you keep the report.</p>

          <h2 id="clause-5" className={h2}>5. The fix cap (&quot;we keep going, within limits&quot;)</h2>
          <C n="5.1">A conversion action on the fix list is <strong className="font-medium">working</strong> when all four of these are true:</C>
          <ol className="list-none space-y-2 pl-6">
            <li>(a) HubSpot&apos;s sync status shows no error for it;</li>
            <li>(b) Google Ads conversion diagnostics show it as active, with no error;</li>
            <li>(c) it&apos;s set as Primary or Secondary, as agreed in the report; and</li>
            <li>(d) a test contact we move through that stage is recorded.</li>
          </ol>
          <C n="5.2">Working doesn&apos;t mean the HubSpot and Google Ads counts match. HubSpot&apos;s own documentation says the totals may not match.</C>
          <C n="5.3">If an item on the fix list isn&apos;t working at handover, we put in up to 10 extra hours within 30 days of handover, at no extra cost.</C>
          <C n="5.4">If an in-scope item still isn&apos;t working when we reach that cap, we refund the second payment.</C>
          <C n="5.5">The fix cap doesn&apos;t cover:</C>
          <ul className={list}>
            <li>causes outside our scope, such as website code outside Tag Manager;</li>
            <li>changes made by you, your agency or your client after handover;</li>
            <li>Google or HubSpot outages; or</li>
            <li>low lead volume.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="clause-6" className={h2}>6. Monthly plan</h2>
          <C n="6.1">The monthly plan is a monitored-accounts plan, not a bank of hours.</C>
          <C n="6.2">Each month, on each account, we:</C>
          <ul className={list}>
            <li>run monthly checks of the HubSpot to Google Ads connection (sync errors, the count gap, click ID coverage, changes to Primary conversions, and consent);</li>
            <li>send a white-label monthly note; and</li>
            <li>fix anything that breaks, up to 1.5 hours per account.</li>
          </ul>
          <C n="6.3">Other work is quoted separately under clause 2.5.</C>
          <C n="6.4">There&apos;s a 3-month minimum. After that, the plan runs month to month until either of us gives 30 days&apos; written notice.</C>

          <h2 id="clause-7" className={h2}>7. Refunds</h2>
          <C n="7.1">The kickoff payment is refundable in full only if we can&apos;t start within 5 business days of receiving access. Once work starts, it&apos;s non-refundable, except under clause 5.4.</C>
          <C n="7.2">There are no refunds for part months on the monthly plan.</C>

          <h2 id="clause-8" className={h2}>8. Your responsibilities</h2>
          <C n="8.1">You&apos;re responsible for having a lawful basis, consent and privacy notices for the contact data that is synced to Google.</C>
          <C n="8.2">
            You keep the access we need in place while the work is under way. Delays caused by missing access or late approvals pause the delivery clock and the 30-day fix cap clock in clause 5.3. If the access we need is still missing 30 days after kickoff, either of us can end the work by email, and we refund the kickoff payment less any time already spent at $150 an hour.
          </C>

          <h2 id="clause-9" className={h2}>9. Access and data</h2>
          <C n="9.1">We ask only for the access the work needs, through named user invites. We never use shared passwords, and our accounts use two-step login.</C>
          <C n="9.2">You can revoke our access at any time. We remove our access at handover unless you&apos;re on the monthly plan.</C>
          <C n="9.3">We don&apos;t export or copy contact records. Screenshots blur personal data.</C>
          <C n="9.4">We delete working files within 30 days of the work ending.</C>
          <C n="9.5">For personal data in your accounts, we act only on your instructions, as a processor.</C>
          <C n="9.6">
            <strong className="font-medium">Data processing terms.</strong> When we process personal data for you under these terms, this clause is our data processing agreement, including for article 28 of the UK GDPR and the EU GDPR. If you&apos;re an agency acting for your client, we act as your sub-processor on the same terms.
          </C>
          <div className="space-y-3 pl-6">
            <p>
              <strong className="font-medium">(a) Subject matter and duration:</strong> the work in these terms, for as long as we have access to your accounts, plus the 30 days in clause 9.4.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="font-medium">(b) Nature and purpose:</strong> reviewing and changing settings in your HubSpot, Google Ads and Tag Manager accounts, testing conversions, and preparing the report, change log and recorded walkthrough of the report. We don&apos;t record calls with you unless you agree in writing beforehand.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="font-medium">(c) Types of personal data:</strong> contact and lead data in your accounts that we see while doing the work, such as names, work email addresses, lifecycle stages, form submissions and click IDs, and the names and email addresses of your account users. We don&apos;t export or copy contact records (clause 9.3).
            </p>

              <strong className="font-medium">(d) Data subjects:</strong> your contacts and leads, and the users of your accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="font-medium">(e) Instructions:</strong> we process personal data only on your documented instructions. Those are these terms, the fix list you approve, and your written instructions by email. We&apos;ll tell you if we think an instruction breaks data protection law.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="font-medium">(f) Confidentiality:</strong> anyone who works on your accounts is bound by confidentiality.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="font-medium">(g) Security:</strong> we keep the measures in clauses 9.1 to 9.4: named user invites, two-step login, only the access the work needs, no exports, blurred screenshots, and deletion of working files within 30 days of the work ending.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="font-medium">(h) Sub-processors:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul className={list}>
              <li>You authorise us to use the providers listed in our <Link href="/privacy" className="link">privacy policy</Link> as sub-processors.</li>
              <li>We keep working files, including screenshots, the walkthrough recording and any call recording you agreed to, only in accounts that {site.legalName} holds with those providers.</li>
              <li>We&apos;ll email you at least 14 days before we add or replace a sub-processor. You can object in that time.</li>
              <li>If we can&apos;t resolve your objection, you can end the work, and we&apos;ll refund fees for work we haven&apos;t done.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong className="font-medium">(i) Assistance:</strong> as far as we reasonably can, we help you answer requests from people using their data protection rights. We also help with security, breach notifications, impact assessments and consultations with regulators.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="font-medium">(j) Breaches:</strong> we tell you without undue delay after we become aware of a personal data breach affecting your data.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="font-medium">(k) End of the work:</strong> we delete your personal data as set out in clause 9.4, unless the law requires us to keep it. We&apos;ll confirm the deletion if you ask.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="font-medium">(l) Audits:</strong> we give you the information you need to show compliance with this clause. We also allow audits by you, or by an auditor you appoint, on reasonable notice and at your cost, no more than once a year unless a regulator requires it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="font-medium">(m) International transfers:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul className={list}>
              <li>We work from South Africa, and our company is in the United States.</li>
              <li>
                Where data protection law requires a safeguard for a transfer, these apply and form part of these terms:
                <ul className="mt-2 list-[circle] space-y-2 pl-6">
                  <li>the EU standard contractual clauses (Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914, module two, controller to processor);</li>
                  <li>for UK data, the UK International Data Transfer Addendum.</li>

              </li>
              <li>The details those clauses need are in (a) to (d), and the security measures are in (g).</li>

            <p>
              <strong className="font-medium">(n) Signed copy:</strong> if you need a signed copy of these data processing terms, ask before kickoff and we&apos;ll sign one.

          <C n="10.4">A case study only applies when you take the pilot discount, and it uses wording you approve.</C>
          <C n="10.5">
            For 12 months after our last work for you, we won&apos;t sell directly to the clients we worked on through you, unless you agree in writing. If one of those clients contacts us directly, we refer them back to you.

          <h2 id="clause-11" className={h2}>11. Liability</h2>
          <C n="11.1">Our total liability is capped. For a check and fix or pilot, the cap is the fees you paid for it. For the monthly plan, it&apos;s the fees you paid in the last 3 months.</C>
          <C n="11.2">We&apos;re not liable for ad spend, bidding results, lost revenue, or any indirect or consequential loss.</C>
          <C n="11.3">We don&apos;t guarantee ad performance. Smart Bidding decisions are Google&apos;s.</C>
          <C n="11.4">Google and HubSpot change their products, features and documentation, and that&apos;s outside our control.</C>

          <C n="13.3">
            For the monthly plan, we&apos;ll email you at least 30 days before a change applies to you. A change doesn&apos;t apply during your 3-month minimum unless the law, or a change that Google or HubSpot makes, requires it. If you don&apos;t accept a change, you can cancel by email before it takes effect. You won&apos;t need to give the 30-day notice in clause 6.4, and if the change applies during your 3-month minimum, you won&apos;t pay for the rest of the minimum.
